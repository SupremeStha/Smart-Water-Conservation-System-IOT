# IoT-Based Smart Water Conservation System ðŸ’§

I have designed and developed a **smart irrigation and water monitoring system** designed using Arduino and multiple sensors, aimed at promoting efficient water usage in agriculture or home gardening. The system monitors environmental conditions such as **soil moisture**, **temperature**, **light intensity**, and **water tank level**, and makes decisions to control water flow and alert users based on the readings.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features

- **Soil Moisture Monitoring** â€“ Determines when to water the plants.
- **Temperature Sensor (TMP36)** â€“ Adjusts motor (pump) speed based on ambient temperature.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor** â€“ Detects water tank levels and prevents motor operation during low water.
- **Light Sensor (LDR)** â€“ Adjusts motor behavior based on light intensity.
- **Automated Motor Control** â€“ Varies motor output based on environmental inputs.
- **Visual and Audio Alerts** â€“ Uses RGB LEDs and a buzzer to indicate system status and warnings.
- **LCD Display (I2C)** â€“ Shows live data: moisture %, temperature, light %, and water level status.
- **Serial Monitor Output** â€“ For real-time logs and debugging via Serial Monitor.
- **Safety Mechanism** â€“ Prevents watering if water tank is empty or soil is already moist.

##  Purpose

Designed with sustainability in mind, this system is intended to:
- Reduce unnecessary water usage
- Automate basic irrigation control
- Alert users in real time when attention is needed
- Provide actionable environmental data to users

This project can serve as a foundation for larger smart agriculture systems or home automation setups.
